"""
Project management utilities for working with Python projects and pyproject.toml files.

This module provides functionality to discover, load, and manipulate Python projects
within a workspace. It supports:
- Finding projects by name or path
- Reading and modifying pyproject.toml configurations
- Discovering workspace member projects
- Managing project dependencies and relationships

The Project class wraps a pyproject.toml file and provides convenient access to
project metadata.
